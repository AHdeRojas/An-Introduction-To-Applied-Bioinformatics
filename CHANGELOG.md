## Version 0.1.1

### Content changes

* First complete version of the *Reading IAB* chapter ([#101](https://github.com/gregcaporaso/An-Introduction-To-Applied-Bioinformatics/issues/101)).
* Dynamically generated tables of contents added through-out the text.
* *Edit on GitHub* links now included throughout the text, which allow readers to submit changes to content (such as typo fixes, etc) very easily using GitHub's online editor.
* Stub for glossary added ([#126](https://github.com/gregcaporaso/An-Introduction-To-Applied-Bioinformatics/issues/126)). This content will be expanded over time.
