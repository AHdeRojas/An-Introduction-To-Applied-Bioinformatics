Contributing to An Introduction to Applied Bioinformatics
=========================================================

Thanks for your interest in contributing to *An Introduction to Applied Bioinformatics*!

An Introduction to Applied Bioinformatics, or IAB, is an open source project and we welcome community contributions. Contributions should generally be made in the form of GitHub pull requests. 

As of the time of this writing, [@gregcaporaso](https://github.com/gregcaporaso) is the primary author/developer, and is working on figuring out how to most efficiently accept community contributions. The problem is that it's currently challenging to diff IPython Notebooks, and it's hard to resolve merge conflicts in IPython Notebooks. For that reason I (sadly) may implement some type of *check out* approach that we can use to ensure that only a single person is working on a notebook at a time. While I'm working this out, to avoid wasting your time making changes that I can't merge, it's best to comment on existing issues (or create new issues) indicating what you want to work on, and wait for me to approve your starting to work on some changes. This will ensure that changes will be efficiently mergable. In general, I'll likely suggest that you submit your pull requests on a chapter-by-chapter basis, rather than as a single large pull request that touches several chapters. I'm working on improving this process, and will update this document when I do.
