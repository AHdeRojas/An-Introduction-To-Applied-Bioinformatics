      "What: \n",
      "\n",
      "The process of inferring the evolutionary relationships between organisms or groups of organisms, and usually representing that information as a tree. \n",
      "\n",
      "Why:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Make functional inferences about genes. \n",
      "2. Understand relationships between organisms (and therefore possible similarities between them). \n",
      "3. Compare the composition of communities of organisms (but we'll come back to this).\n",
      "\n",
      "How:\n",
      "\n",
      "By comparing traits of extant organisms. In our case, traits are columns in a multiple sequence alignment. Many algorithms and tools exist for achieving this, and they vary widely in runtime and quality of results. We're going to begin by learning about one of the oldest and simplest methods for doing this: *Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean* or UPGMA. (Don't be scared by the name - it's actually fairly simple.) \n",
      "\n",
      "UPGMA is a heirarchical clustering algorithm. It is widely used, though it's application in phylogenetics is usually restricted to building preliminary trees to \"guide\" the process of multiple sequence alignment, as it makes some assumptions that don't work well for inferring relationships between organsims. We're going to start with it here however for a few reasons. First, the underlying math is very basic, so we don't need to assume anything about your background. Second, there are some other applications of UPGMA that we'll explore later, including grouping samples based on their species compositions. In general, my strategy with teaching this material is to start by giving you a basic introdution into how a process works so you can visualize and do it. From there, we can get more complex."
